# Class Project 1 Refactoring
    As a class we were tasked with refactoring code from a provided starter code 

# Description
1. We took a starter code that was not written in semantic HTML and-
    refactored it to be more readable and accessible user friendly for everyone!

2. Personally I rewrote all code to get practice in what we will be-
    doing in the future. (this proved to be more of a challenge than I anticipated)


# Issues Faced During Project
1. Alignment on headers proved tricky and the second box and all- 
    content in general is not spaced correctly and I will look to fix- 
    as I get progress more in the bootcamp.
2. Refactoring code was a fun but daunting process, I spent alot -
    of hours reading the same things over and over trying to figure out-
    issues that I created but found the challenge fun and informative.
3. Deployment was a challenege because of the way I named the folders- 
    originally (using capital letters) I found out changing folder names-
    on GitHub can be tricky so I troubleshooted by making links in HTML- 
    match folder names with capitalization.
